# GDPR.CASH

The General Data Protection Regulation, commonly referred to as GDPR starts with this
sentence "The protection of natural persons in relation to the processing of personal data
1 is a fundamental right." This is what GDPR is trying to achieve in a nutshell, namely the
protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of their personal data and the
free movement of such data.

th Even though GDPR is set to come into effect very soon, on the 25 of May, 2018, there is
still insufficient information and preparation on behalf of businesses and organizations.
These businesses and organizations must become GDPR-complaint until the
above-mentioned date in order to avoid the heavy fines the European Union intends to
impose on violators, either â‚¬20 million or up to 4% of their worldwide turnover, whichever
is higher. The new set of regulations will apply to all businesses and organizations that
serve citizens across the 28 EU member states, regardless of which part of the world the
said business entities are based in.

GDPR.CASH was conceived as an answer to a much-needed call - the current state of
GDPR-readiness among companies and organizations. It is intended as a resolution to a
variety of GDPR-related problems such as the lack of information, time, resources, and IT
budget as well as the difficulty in finding support and vetting the experts and solutions.

The aim of the GDPR.CASH team is to create a one-stop solution for "all things GDPR"
through a GDPR-related services and products marketplace, an expert network, a job
board, proof of demand and proof of service. GDPR.CASH will also create a comprehensive
learning platform for everything related to GDPR, which is to feature podcasts, video
lessons, etc.
